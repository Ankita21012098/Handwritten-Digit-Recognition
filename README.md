This project demonstrates a deep learning approach to recognizing handwritten digits using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9). Additionally, the project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) to allow users to draw digits and see real-time predictions.


Features:
1.Deep Learning Model: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras and TensorFlow for high accuracy in digit recognition.
2.MNIST Dataset: Utilizes the popular MNIST dataset for training and evaluation.
3.Graphical User Interface (GUI): An intuitive interface built with Tkinter to draw digits and get instant predictions.
4.Real-time Predictions: The GUI provides immediate feedback on the drawn digit.

Requirements:
1.Python 3.x
2.TensorFlow
3.Keras
4.NumPy
5.Matplotlib
6.Tkinter (for the GUI)
